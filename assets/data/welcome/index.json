This is the first one!</p>\n<p><strong>A few things you should know upfront</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for.</li>\n<li>The entire platform can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's very powerful, but does require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.</li>\n<li>For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our Ghost(Pro) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.</p>\n<p>The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">community</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-up-the-editor\"><a href=\"#next-up-the-editor\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Next up, the editor</h2>\n<p>The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: <a href=\"/the-editor\">the Ghost editor</a>. This is where the good stuff happens.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the way, once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default <strong>Ghost</strong> user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts! </p>\n</blockquote>\n"}},"context":{}}
